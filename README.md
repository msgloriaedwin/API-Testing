#API Testing
This repository demonstrates my expertise in API testing using Postman. It includes collections that showcase various testing scenarios, such as:

CRUD operations
-Authentication workflows
-Error handling and edge cases
-Response validation

#How to Use
-Clone this repository.
-Import any JSON file from the Collections/ folder into Postman.
-Select the appropriate environment and explore the requests.
-Run tests individually or use the Postman Collection Runner for automated testing.

#Tools and Skills
Postman: For creating, testing, and managing API requests.
Newman (optional): For running collections in the command line.

#Skills Demonstrated:
-Designing detailed and reusable test cases for APIs.
-Validating response data, status codes, and headers.
-Identifying edge cases and testing error scenarios.

#Sample API Collections
-JSONPlaceholder API: Test CRUD operations with a free online REST API.
-Cryptocurrency Wallet API: Validate wallet creation, balance retrieval, transaction history, and fund transfers.
-Payment Workflow API: Test payment processing, refund management, and status updates.
-PetStore API: Simulate inventory management, order processing, and user registration.

Additional Notes
Environment files for each API are available in the Environments/ folder to simplify testing.
